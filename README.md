# Minelog - vAlpha

An (awesome) plateform for Minecraft players. Working with a server-side plugin which populates the minelog database with informations like block placed/broken, pvp ratio, etc.

## Getting started ##

### Linux installation ###

First, you will need to install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/â€Ž) if it is not already done. [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/) is also required.
After cloning this repo, install the sails dependency:
```sh
npm install  -g sails
```
Then install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
You can launch the app with the following command:
```sh
sails lift
```

### First test ###

To ensure everything run smoothly, have a try at **http://127.0.0.1:1337/User/create?pseudo=user1**
You are good to go!

### Fixtures ###

To populate the database : ``` /Fixtures/populate ```
